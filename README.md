# Hola, I'm Omar üö∂üèª

I'm a Software Engineer (AI/ML) by training, and a [freelance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MIEZSgQYHE) [content](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFlLzFuslfQ) [creator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISa10TrJK7w&t=6s). Currently, I'm working with LLMs to help students to get better at PAES (Chilean college entrance exam), and fine-tunning models to get better at teaching itself, and math reasoning skills. I'm also excited about Cognitive Science, with a strong focus on Artificial Intelligence, Social Learning, and Brain-Computer Interfaces. I'm highly biased towards pragmatism, thinking outside-the-box, and first principles thinking.

In my free time, I enjoy [making music](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5e6x7QJXOGbkDEPpEOWm1w) in Ableton, training, and traveling.
