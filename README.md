# Hola, I'm Omar üö∂üèª

I'm a Software Engineer (AI/ML) by training and currently work in Developer Relations at [Kilo Code](https://www.kilocode.ai), where we're building the future of coding‚Äîright inside your VSCode. I'm also a [freelance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MIEZSgQYHE) [content](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFlLzFuslfQ) [creator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISa10TrJK7w), excited about neuroscience‚Äîespecially using models like brain organoids, artificial intelligence, and brain-computer interfaces to better understand the brain.  

I did my thesis on fine-tuning LLMs to improve self-teaching and mathematical reasoning skills, aiming to ace the Chilean Higher Education Access Test (PAES).

I'm deeply biased toward pragmatism, thinking outside the box, and first-principles reasoning. I consider myself a product person at heart‚ÄîI love building and discovering creative engineering solutions that deliver real value to both companies and individuals.

In my free time, I enjoy [making music](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5e6x7QJXOGbkDEPpEOWm1w) in Ableton, learning Mandarin (‰Ω†Â•ΩÔºÅ), and traveling.
