# Hola, I'm Omar üö∂üèª

I'm a Software Engineer by training, and a freelance content creator (filmmaker and photographer). I consider myself a very creative person, and I like to work at the intersection of tech and media. Currently, I'm passionate about using tech, grit, and creativity to create value for individuals and companies, and having fun solving difficult problems along the way. I'm proficient with Full Stack Python (Django, Flask), AWS, Node.js, and React.js.

I'm the founder of Nomad Top, a startup focused on creating a Universal Passport that allows individuals to live and work anywhere. I've been learning a lot about startups, particularly in engineering and product development. I'm excited about high tech industries such as Artificial Intelligence, Brain-Computer Interfaces, and Neurotechnology. I'm highly biased towards pragmatism, thinking outside-the-box, and first principles thinking. I'm a big fan of the new wave of nomadic, remote work lifestyles, and the travel industry. Plus, I love open-source culture in general.

In my free time, I enjoy making music in Ableton, hiking, and traveling.
