# Hola, I'm Omar üö∂üèª

I'm a Software Engineer (AI/ML) by training, and a [freelance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MIEZSgQYHE) [content](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFlLzFuslfQ) [creator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISa10TrJK7w&t=6s). I like to work at the intersection of tech and media. Currently, I'm passionate about using tech, grit, and creativity to create value for individuals and companies, and having fun solving difficult problems along the way.

I'm the founder of Nomad Top, a startup focused on creating a Universal Passport that allows individuals to live and work anywhere seamlessly. I'm also excited about Cognitive Science, with a strong focus on Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Brain-Computer Interfaces. I'm highly biased towards pragmatism, thinking outside-the-box, and first principles thinking.

In my free time, I enjoy making music in Ableton, hiking, and traveling.
