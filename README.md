# Hola, I'm Omar üö∂üèª

I'm a Software Engineer (AI/ML) by training, currently, I'm working as Artificial Intelligence Engineer at [Emergent Mind](https://www.emergentmind.com), we're building a platform to accelerate discovery and learning about the latest AI research. I'm also a [freelance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MIEZSgQYHE) [content](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFlLzFuslfQ) [creator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISa10TrJK7w) enthusiastic about Cognitive Science, with a focus on AI, Learning, and Brain-Computer Interfaces. I did my thesis on tuning LLM models to get better at teaching itself, and math reasoning skills to ace the Chilean Higher Education Access Test (PAES).

I'm highly biased towards pragmatism, thinking outside-the-box, and first principles thinking. I consider myself as a product person, I like building, and finding creative engineering solutions that deliver actual value for companies and individuals.

In my free time, I enjoy [making music](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5e6x7QJXOGbkDEPpEOWm1w) in Ableton, learning mandarin (‰Ω†Â•ΩÔºÅ), and traveling.
